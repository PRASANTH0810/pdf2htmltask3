    <p>We will now study more complex problems considering:</p>
    <i><p>Multiple criteria or goals:</p></i>
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considering earnings or costs, delays, client satisfaction, etc, and</p>
    <i><p>Multiple scenarios:</p></i>
    <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where each scenario has a different risk level</p>
    <p>In the multiple goal function problems, there is no optimum solution fully
        satisfying all goals at the same time. The individual goal’s functions are, in
        general, conflicting and it is not possible to have an optimization method to solve</p>

        <p>the problem. There is usually a<i> consensus </i>solution satisfying minimal criteria of
        optimum values for each individual goal function. This consensus is based on the
        <i>Pareto’s principle</i> presented in chapter nine. The optimal decision making in
        problems with multiple goals will be analyzed at the end of this chapter
        (Goicoechea et al., 1982; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976; Dyson, 1990; Saaty, 1980,
        1994; Bonabeau, 2003; Charan, 2001; Choo, 1998; Day et al., 1997).<br/><br/>

        In considering restrictions across several scenarios, the problem solution
        becomes more difficult due to the high number of possible combinations of goal
        functions and scenarios to be considered.<br/><br/>
        Using classical mathematical programming notation, the optimization problem
        with <i>k</i> goals and <i>w</i> scenarios could be formulated as follows:</p>

<center>
        <i><p>Maximize (or Minimize) F (x) = (f<sub>1</sub>(x) , f<sub>2</sub>(x),..., f<sub>k</sub>(x))<br/>
With restrictions:<br/>
Scenario 1: g<sub>1j</sub>(x) < 0, (j=1,2,..., m<sub>1</sub>) and x R<sup>n</sup>.;<br/>
…<br/>
Scenario w: g<sub>wj</sub> (x) < 0, (j=1,2,..., m<sub>w</sub>) and x R<sup>n</sup>.;</p>
        </i></center>

 <p>An efficient algorithm for this kind of problem has not yet been presented,
    unless using some kind of heuristic techniques. It should be noted that the
    mathematical programming problem formulated above does not consider the
    event of uncertainty or risk, which, in this case, would involve stochastic or
    probabilistic mathematical programming.<br><br>
Thus,the decision-making process is one of the methodologies indicated to
resolve these problems, since it does not depend on complex mathematics
involving scenario restrictions and multiple goals’ functions (Warfield, 1978,
1994).

<p>As shown before, the conversion of any kind of value (quantitative or non

    values for the intermediate values are reached using the utility curve shown on

<b><h3>Joint Utility for the Two Goals: Delay and Cost</h3></b>
<hr>
<p>
    Since there are two goals (or attributes x1 and x2) each value of the utility must
    be found by combining utilities u(x1) and u(x2) of these goals, using a method
    known as <i>swing weight</i> (Clemen and Reilly (2001)), given by the formula u
    (x1, x2) = k1 . u (x1) + k2 . u (x2), where k1 and k2 are weights satisfying the
    equality k1+k2=1.<br/><br/>
    In this method, it is presumed that the utility of the Delay u(x1) is independent
    from the utility of Cost u(x2) and vice-versa, and that there is no interaction
    between the two goals in determining the utility value. It can then be said that
    goals x1 and x2 are <i>mutually independent</i> in regard to utility. If we establish
    a preference saying that Cost is more important than Delay and that Delay has
    70% of the importance of Cost, we would have k1 = 0.7 x k2. Since k1 + k2
    = 1, we have k1 = 0.7 x (1- k1), and then k1 = 0.4 and k2 =0.6.<br/><br/>

    These weights address the following conditions:</p>

    <center>
        <p>
            u(worst delay, worst cost) = u(5 months , $150) = 0.4 0 + 0.6 0 = 0<br/>
u(worst delay, best cost) = u(5 moths , $80) = 0.4 0 + 0.6 1 = 0.6<br/>
u(best delay, worst cost) = u (0 months , $150) = 0.4 1 + 0.6 0 = 0.4<br/>
u(best delay, best cost) = u (0 months , $80) = 0.4 1 + 0.6 1 = 1.0.
        </p>
    </center>

    <div class="content-container">

<p>By replacing costs and delays values by their respective utility values, and
    reaching the joint utility values u (x1, x2), we have a new decision tree:</p>
        
        <img src="img/page%206%20image1.jpg">
    <!----------page6  image 1------------------------------------->


    <p>The Expected Utility Values are:</p>

    <center>
        <p>
            EUV1 = 0.2 0.42 + 0.3 0.34 + 0.5 x 0.54 = 0.456,<br/>
EUV2 = 0.6 0.4 + 0.4 0.60 = 0.48, and<br/>
EUV3 = 0.2 0.4 + 0.4 0.5 + 0.4 0.4 = 0.44.</p>
    </center>
    <p>Thus, the company that prefers to be risk neutral will prefer strategy A2.<br/>
        If the company prefers to choose the utility curve with “risk aversion” we may
        have the following values: EUV1 = 0.541, EUV2 = 0.48 e EUV3 = 0.608, and
        the best decision for the company with risk aversion is A3, where costs are not
        the best but there are better delivery possibilities. Using the curve expressing
        <i>risk preference or risk taker</i>, in Figure 10.1, the company may choose
        alternative A1.</p>

<p>In any decision problem, one should not consider a decision based only on a
    scenario with fixed values of the parameters involved, since several subjective
    assessments were used for structuring the decision problem. The decision
    maker tries to make a decision based on the “best information available” out of
    the several possible variations involved. Which are these variation alternatives?
    </p>
    <center>
        <i>Adecision support system should provide the possibility of answering<br/>
            “What– if” questions, that is, the chance to answer the question<br/><br/>

            the schedule or the probabilities were different?”
            </i>
    </center>
    <p>
        Considering that strategy A1 — Developing the project inside the company —
was the best decision only in the case of risk taker or preference, the company
could make the following question.
    </p>
    <center>
        <i>“What – if?<br/>
            What to do, or in which conditions is strategy A1 the best solution<br/>
            in a risk neutral case?”</i>
    </center>

    <p>Since the example 10.1 is a complex decision case, involving different values
of delays and costs for each scenario, the analysis of the best strategy for each
possible combination of the variations of values demands hard work and is not
always recommended, since it involves several cases with no practical interest.
The sensitivity analysis chart used in the previous example, varying probabilities
p1 and p2, and leaving the third probability p3= 1 – p1 – p2 implicit, is also not
useful, for the same reasons.<br/>
The sensibility analysis should then be limited to the variations of parameters
(probabilities, costs, or delays) of strategy A1, where the company can alter
these values. The two other strategies, including the involvement of other</p>

negotiations with them. Even in strategy A1, only one of the three variables
should be examined at a time (probability, delay, or cost), leaving the others as
they are, to avoid the explosive increase in the number of possible cases.
For instance, the following cases can be examined:

<b><h2>Optimal Decisions</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>
    In the previous chapters, it was stated that a decision problem cannot be solved
    just by scientific models and that, in order to define a decision-making model,
    it is necessary to adopt the <i>“satisfactory model”</i> based on “bounded
    rationality ” such as the “near conflict resolution” or “minimizing uncertainty”.
    Further, it was stressed that the search for a solution should neither be random
    nor exhaustive. The search for a solution within the organization should be
    focused on the main problem goals and the possible alternative solutions should
    be looked for in the vicinity of these goals.<br/>
    However, it is often interesting, or even necessary, to represent and analyze a
    decision problem from the standpoint of its optimum or optimized solution. In
    an optimization scenario, criteria or goals may be considered as objectives to
    be optimized or as part of restricting conditions. In the formulation of Nonlinear
    Mathematical Programming models, every goal or criterion except one can be
    described as a restriction, in order to maintain the mathematical formulation of
    the optimization problem with a single objective (Hillier & Liebermann, 1980;
    Shamblin & Stevens, 1980).<br/>
    In Linear Programming (LP) both a single function goal z and the m restriction
    equations should be <i>linear</i>, in order to enable the applications of the method
    known as SIMPLEX, on a convex region of feasible solutions. If any of these

    equations is <i>nonlinear</i>, the optimization problem should be solved using the
    Nonlinear Programming or Dynamic Programming methods, whose resolution
    is usually very difficult.
</p>
<b><h3>Optimal Multiple Criteria (or Multi-Objective)<br>
    Decision-Making in Industry</h3></b>
    <hr>
    <p>In problems with multiple goals it is not possible to establish an optimum
        solution satisfying every goal or objective. Solutions that address all criteria or
        goals, called “ideal solutions” usually cannot be found among the feasible
        solutions of the original problem. The individual goals are usually conflicting,
        and it is necessary to find a compromise solution based on Pareto’s principle.
        The pre-established restrictions of the available resources may not enable the
        search for an “ideal solution” outside the region of feasible solutions. That
        means that, the ideal solution is unfeasible, as shown in Figure 10.2.
        </p>
        <ol class="custom-list" start="1">
            <li><p>In the case where existing restrictions or resources are not limited, the
                          restrictions may be extended or “relaxed” until they encompass the ideal
                          solution restrictions. That is what happens with the formulation called “De
                          Novo” programming reported in Tabucanon (1988).</p></li>

                    solution close to the ideal solution, respecting the original restriction area.
                    The formulation used in this case is called “global criterion” or the

            <p>The difficulties in solving nonlinear problems occur even when the number of
                variables is small. If the goal function is not linear, there may be the case of
                optimization with several maximum and minimum points. In the case that one of
                restriction equations (or all of them) is nonlinear, the area of feasible solutions
                may be formed by nonconvex regions, and then optimization problem requires
                heuristic algorithms. Usually, the optimization problem of great interest to
                corporations is the optimization of nonlinear problems with multiple goals.
                The best known methods for multiple criteria optimization problems are:

                <p>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Global criterion” method (Kinoshita ,1996),<br/>
• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“De Novo” programming (Tabucanon ,1988), and<br/>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goal programming (Hillier & Liberman, 1980).
                </p>
<p>The first method builds a new goal function by weighting multiple goals functions
    and preserving the area formed by the restrictions equations. The second
    method relaxes (altering the restrictions equations) the restriction area so as to
    hold an optimum solution called “ideal solution.” Goal programming tries to
    reach a compromise establishing qualitative goals to address the demands of
    the optimization problems.</p>

        <p>We briefly describe the use of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) to solve this
            problem. Other multi-objective decision methods, such as ELECTRE I and
            ELECTRE II, described by Goicoechea et al. (1982) and by Roy (1968), can solve
            this problem using a different approach.</p>

        <b><h3>The AHP Method</h3></b>
        <hr>
        <p>
            AHP is a method for choosing the best decision alternative considering multiple
criteria and goals expressed by qualitative or quantitative values. This method
created by Saaty (1980) has been used for the decision problem to establish:
priority definition, cost and profits assessment, resource deployment,
benchmarking, market survey, strategic decisions, conflict negotiation and
resolution, social or political decisions, and forecasts.<br/>
The AHP is based on parity matrixes to express subjective assessment values
attributed to variable pairs of each factor or criterion involved in the problem.
AHP is a single-step decision process, which does not consider risk or
uncertainty.<br/>
Since manual calculation is difficult for decision problems with a large number
of factors or alternatives (usually more than five criteria and five alternatives),
an AHP software known as EXPERT CHOICE should be used. The description of AHP presented in this section is based on an alternative approximation
method for calculation of the eigenvector to determine the relative priority
vector, described by Cook and Russel (1993).<br/>
We do not present the entire sequence of numerical procedure for this problem,
because of the subjective nature involved to define each one of the pairwise
preference matrixes, and also because there is the need to reevaluate these

            the six criteria relative to getting the best route. For instance, criterion F2 is
            strongly preferred to criterion F1 and therefore creates a 5 in the F2 row
            relative to the F1 column. This pairwise comparison also creates a 1/5 in the F1
            row relative to the F2 column. Criterion F2 is equally preferred to F3, creating
            1 in the F2 row relative to F3 column and vice-versa.

                    The other five pairwise comparison matrices should be defined for each one of

<p><b>Step 3.</b> Using the eigen-value method of the software EXPERT CHOICE or
    the alternative approximation method described by Cook and Russel (1993),
    it is possible to determine the relative priority or weight of each decision
    element.</p>
    <p>For instance, considering the pairwise matrix FF, we divide each matrix entry
        by its column total to normalize these values. Then we calculate the arithmetic
        mean of each row. These arithmetic means are estimates of the relative
        priorities (eigenvalues) of the six factors Fi, as shown in the following:

        <p>These relative priorities indicate that the decision maker places most emphasis
            on criterion F5 (priority = 0.367) fallowed by priority F2 (priority 0.235).<br/>
            We must repeat this procedure for the six pairwise comparison matrix of each
            criterion Firelative to the routes Ri, to follow to step 4.

            <p><b>Step 4.</b> Aggregating the relative priorities of the final decision alternatives
                relative to the overall goal.</p>

                <p>For instance, the final decision priority value could be:</p>
                <p>Route 1 = 0.193, Route 2 = 0.188, Route 3 = 0.155. Route 4 = 0.230, and
                    Route 5 = 0.234; , which indicates that route number 5 and number 4 are the
                    best alternatives.</p>
                <p>The quality of the final decision is dependent upon the consistency of the
                    judgement throughout the pairwise comparison process. A measure of consistency called consistency ratio is used to determine the decision-maker
                    consistency after the development of each pairwise comparison matrix. If the</p>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="content-container">
        <p>
            consistency ratio is large, the decision maker should revise the pairwise
comparison matrix. The decision maker can also revise the subjective judgment
giving more preference to one of the criteria or one of the objectives.<br/><br/>
This revisions procedure may introduce changes in the final priority. For
instance, for a different pairwise comparison values, the priority could be:
Route 1 = 0.182, Route 2 = 0.108, Route 3 = 0.171. Route 4 = 0.369, and
Route 5 = 0.170. According to the new decision preference, route number 4
becomes the preferred alternative.<br/><br/>
AHP is one of the most used methods for making decisions with multiple criteria
involving complexity and subjectivity. One of the difficulties pointed out for the
AHP is the amount of required parity comparisons, which increase rapidly with
the number of criteria depending on the complexity of the decision tree. The
reversal effect of the priority order, which occurs when the dominant alternatives are altered due to the inclusion or exclusion of irrelevant alternatives, is
another problem pointed to by AHP critics (Harker, 1987). The order reversal
effect is attributed by researchers as a “side effect” of the calculus used to
normalize the priority vector. In response to this problem, Saaty (1977 &
1980) created the “ideal mode” calculation, indicated for the case when only
the best alternative is desired.<br/><br/>
The ANP — Analytic Network Process (Saaty, 2001) is a generalization of
AHP where one of the axioms (independency of the factors) may be relaxed.
While AHP hierarchic structure has a concept of dominance of one level over
another, in ANP there may be closed cycles where there is a net structure that
can give a new dimension and view for structuring complex problems.<br/>

        meaning that the decision maker must know the value of this probability. As in
        a practical problem with uncertainty or risk this fact is seldom possible, authors

               ) , (for Aj<sup>c</sup>
                Ai), is the sum of basic

        <p>According to the description presented in Chapter VIII, we have the following
            five criteria, placed in ascending order of their importance.
            </p>
            <p>OI ={ s1 = year of fabrication, s2 = exterior aspects, s3 = interior aspects, s4
                = mileage , s5 = price },</p>

                <p>P1 = { m1 = 0.075, m2 = 0.139, m3 = 0.026, m4 = 0.460, m5 = 0.294 }.</p>
                <p>The criterion s5 is the “most important” because when states or criteria sj (j=
                    1,2,...,k) are ordered defining subsets A<sub>q</sub> = { sj / wj w<sub>q</sub> }, q= 1,2,...,k, the
                    last criterion s5 appears in every subset Aq, in order to evaluate the values of
                    lower and upper expected values. The criterion s4 is the “most preferred”
                    because the preference decision maker has resulted in the highest value of basic
                    probability m4 = 0.460.</p>
                    <p>The values of utility function u (rl, sj), for l = 1, 2, ..., 6 used cars and sj =
                        1,2,...,5 criteria are presented in Table 10.2.</p>
                        <p>We can note that, with the exception of car number X768, every car presents
                            at least one positive aspect (i.e., preference value is equal to or greater than 0.7)

                            of these cars.

            <p>Car A783 seems to be the best choice, showing two first places and one second
                place, although it has a score of zero for the “exterior aspects.” However, as
                this criterion s2 is one of the least important criteria, it could not affect this
                customer’s selection</p>
                <p>Car M718 presents a balanced situation: it is the best car with respect to
                    negative points (E<sub>lower</sub> or E*) and has slightly lower value with respect to the
                    arithmetic mean and positive points (E<sub>upper</sub>= E*= 0.800), when compared with
                    car A783. Car A783 has two first places, but it has a zero entry for the criterion
                    s2. That, however, is one of the less important criteria.</p>
                    <p>Car X785 presents more negative points (E<sub>lower</sub> = 0.457) and less positive
                        points (E<sub>upper</sub>
                         = 0.782) than the two cars previously considered. As it would
                        be expected, car X768 presents the worst performance in every aspect of
                        analysis.</p>

  In each of the above mentioned cases, the mistake made was not asking
themselves the critical question: “what happens if we are wrong — and very
wrong?” In other words, they mistakenly assessed the risks inherent to their
decisions or did not make the correct scenario planning.<br/><br/>
There are two very different kinds of scenario planning. The first is exploratory,
an attempt to understand the outlines of an unknown scenario — the future —
especially in a general interest context. Exploratory planning may find potential
unforeseen risks, but is not always relevant to the decision maker.<br/><br/>
The second kind of planning tries to reach an understanding of risk management. Decision-making scenarios are not created from the abstract. One must
know who the decision makers are, since they also make decisions based both
on perceptions and facts.<br/><br/>
For the scenario planning, it is important that the team developing the range
of future alternatives is sure that the “official future” is included in the range
of alternatives. Only after analyzing this scenario, with a well-made survey,
should other possibilities be considered.<br/><br/>
How to identify and describe the official future? It is necessary to examine
the decision makers’ knowledge, their organizational environment and the
market where they act. This test could be condensed into five questions:

                    scenario for the best possible result?</p></li>

        <p>
            Scenarios may be used to train decision makers in recognizing signs of change
on the proper occasions. Scenarios are useful to introduce gradual changes in
the decision-making models themselves. In sum, scenarios show the decision
makers their own perception of the risk environment.</p>

<b><h2>Conclusions</h2></b>
<hr>
<p>In this chapter, complexity in decision problems due to uncertainty or risk
    factor, multiple scenario definition and multiple criteria decision, were presented. Subjective assessment of probability values, scenario definition and
    multiple criteria decision with or without optimized solution, are problems that
    do not have definitive answers, requiring several steps of the decision-making
    process to reach favorable and consensual results.</p>
    <p>In addition to the basic structure of the decision-making process of semistructured and tactical models of decision, we are facing new factors that
        encompass the complex and nonstructured nature of strategic decision problems.</p>
        <p>Complex problems and nonstructured (known also as ill-defined) problems are
            often considered similar problems, but it is possible to find complexity (in the
            sense of NP or Non-Polynomial complexity defined in Mathematics) in welldefined problems (small number of variables and functions), as in the case of
            optimization of nonlinear problems or matrix inversion problems.</p>
            <p>Summarizing the results of a decision based on the models and examples shown in
                this chapter, one can say that the selection of the best or top best alternatives of
                decision is a difficult task. We may think about certain personal considerations and
                organizational biases a decision analysis should overcome, and the concept of
                “good” rather than “best” decision must be considered.</p>
                <p>The choice of an adequate decision-making methodology will be one of
                    personal or organizational preference, and we can not decide a priori which
                    particular methodology is appropriate. Rather, we may analyze a problem
                    according to different points of view to see what the outcomes for different
                    ways of analysis are, and in this way determine which course of action is most
                    justifiable.</p>
